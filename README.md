![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)

- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript.
- Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature.
- It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services.

![Webpack](https://img.shields.io/badge/webpack-%238DD6F9.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=webpack&logoColor=black)

- Webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.
