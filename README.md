- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript.
- Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature.
- It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services.
